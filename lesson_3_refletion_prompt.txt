When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Anytime you are working in a group, or even posting a repository for revisions, you would
want to use a remote repository so that outside users can have access to your project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You don't want to have an access amount of unnecessary files. Also you want to know what you're pulling to you're local
repository every time. If there are conflicting files you can risk have you're local repository being overwritten
by the remote repository.
