What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates a master branch and marks all the files in the directory as unmarked, which means they're files that haven't
been added to the repository via commit. Initailizing a repository creates a master branch in the current directory
which means that all files within the current directory an sub-directories will be included in the commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area contains all the files that will be committed from the working directory to the repository, files
can be individually added and removed from the staging area. This allows the programming to makes changes to multuple
files all at once and the commit them seperately, which in turn could be very helpful in the debugging process.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

To check which files are added to the staging area the command git status is used. If any unwanted files are in the
staging area they can be removed using the git reset file.name command.
